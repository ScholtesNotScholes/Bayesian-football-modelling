# Bayesian-football-modelling

## Project Overview

This project was completed as a master's dissertation titled "Bayesian Hierarchical Approach for Position and Player Adjusted Expected Goals in Football (Soccer)".

The aim of the project was to investigate if there were significant differences in goal probabilities for different positions of players (strikers, midfielders, etc.) and different players themselves (e.g. Lionel Messi). This was investigated using Bayesian hierarchical modelling and comparing results of models with and without positional or player effects to see how goal probability was impacted.

The project included, among other things, the following processes:

- Data extraction from StatsBomb API.
- Data cleaning.
- Feature transformation and creation.
- Frequentist logistic regression modelling.
- Bayesian hierarchical logistic regression modelling.
